# calculator
The principal proceeding seemed very clear for me in the beginning -- I thought it has to be very similar to the first vanilla JavaScript tutorials I followed (and it realy was, kind of). But the Out- and Inputfeature (instead of plain JS-calculations in the console) let me struggle soon. 

I managed to find a effective way to handle the task given with using the math.js library for parsing strings and use them as operations. 

## What I learned
Though I am not responsible for all that cool math.js-stuff and computing I found the library during my very own search for solutions, studied the documentation, saw a usefull tool in it and implemented the calculator with its help.

I clearly see now the links to my former study subject in the humanities and how good research skills might help when trying to implement something new and searching for an solution. The standard white paper problem comes to mind immediately, too. Interestingly the techniques to overcome these problems seem not to be very different in Arabic sciences and web development.

## Project-URL:
You can find the project in the wild on my [webpage](https://do-webdev.de/), which might be under construction. 
But the Project is already reachable: [https://do-webdev.de/projects/calculator/](https://do-webdev.de/projects/calculator/).
